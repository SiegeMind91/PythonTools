#RegEx isn't a tool that is limited to Python, but I wanted to showcase how to use it within the Python language. 

#Here's a simple example, making sure that the entered string starts with a capital letter
# Import re module
import re

# Take any string data
string = input("Enter a string value: ")
# Define the searching pattern
pattern = '^[A-Z]'

# match the pattern with input value
found = re.match(pattern, string)

# Print message based on the return value
if found:
  print("The input value is started with the capital letter")
else:
  print("You have to type string start with the capital letter"
  
  
#Here's another example, it uses the search() function to check if the string starts with "The" and ends with "dog"
import re

txt = "The brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
pattern = "^The.*dog$"
x = re.search(pattern, txt)

If x:
  print("Input was a pattern match!")
else:
  print("Input was not a pattern match")
  
  
#This example uses the findall() function to find any matches of "ai" in the given string
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", txt)
print(x)


#Finally, this example shows how we might find emails in a provided list or string:
import re 
  
# Example string 
s = """Hello from hotRocksAZ199630@gmail.com
        to CampWorld123@yahoo.com about the meeting @2PM"""
  
# \S matches any non-whitespace character 
# @ for as in the Email 
# + for Repeats a character one or more times 
lst = re.findall('\S+@\S+', s)     
  
# Printing of List 
print(lst)
