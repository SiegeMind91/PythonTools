Linear Data Structures 

Why Study Linear Data Structures?
    + Coding challenges that make use of linear data structures are 
        common in technical interviews for entry-level roles
    + Some interviewers believe a candidates knowledge of data structures 
        is indicative of the depth of their knowledge about computer science 
        topics
    + Sometimes a common data structure may be an ideal tool to help 
        solve a problem, whether in a technical interview or in a real product

Stacks - Like a stack of pancakes 
    + Last In, First Out (LIFO)
    + Add and remove items in constant time 
    + Maintain items in the order they were added 
    + Best Use Case:
        - When you want quick access to the most recent item and need to keep the 
            items in order 

Queues - Like a line of people 
    + First In, First Out (FIFO)
    + Add items in constant time; remove items in linear time 
    + Maintain items in order they were added 
    + Best Use Case:
        - When you want to process the items in the order in which they were added 
    
Singly Linked List 
    + Made of a series of connected nodes 
    + Can only move forward through the connected nodes 
    + Adds and removes nodes before or after any key in the linked list 
    + Maintains items in order, based on when/where you add nodes 
        + Best Use Case:
            - Unknown number of items to store 
            - One-directional movement is OK
            - Need to insert items between other items 
            - Sequential access is OK 

Doubly Linked List 
    + Made of a series of connected nodes 
    + Can move forward and backward thourhg the connected nodes 
    + Adds and removes nodes before or after any key in the linked list
    + Maintains items in order, based on when/where you add nodes 
        + Best Use Case:
            - Unknown number of items to store 
            - Need to insert items in between other items 
            - Sequential access is OK
