Recursion 

Recursion - an elegant method of solving a problem where the solution 
    depends on solutions to smaller occurrences of the same problem 

How to Approach Recursion
    1. Divide a problem into subproblems 
        a. Must be the same type as the original
    2. Solve those subproblems 
    3. Combine the results to solve the original 

Parts of a Recursive Solution
    1. Base case/degenerate case 
        a. "How do I know when I'm done recursing?"
        b. Smallest slice of the problem is treated differently
    2. Recursive case/progress
        a. Continue reducing the problem until reaching the base case 

Example:
    def get_list_length(my_list):
        if my_list ==[]  <----- Base Case 
            return 0
        return 1 + get_list_length(my_list[1:]) <---- Progress - slicing off the first character of the list and passing the rest to the recursive function
